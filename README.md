# Tank Mates

Tank Mates is an mobile application for iOS/Android for determining the compatibility and recommended parameters for combinations of freshwater fish species.

## Motivation

This project was created after experimenting with both React Native and Flutter for cross-platform development. Historically I have been a native Android developer but with the hype on cross-platform frameworks I had to give those a try. I fell in love with Flutter and decided to pursue my idea of creating a simple to use aquarium compatibility application. I plan to maintain and add many more features to this application in the future.

## Features

* Add up to 200 different species of freshwater fish
* Determine compatibility between species
* Find out if your tank can support your fish when full grown
* Get recommendations for incompatible tanks

Many more updates to come in the future such as additional species, salt water fish, non-adult fish options, planted tanks, and much more!

## Installation

Tank Mates can be downloaded and installed through the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loftydevelopment.tank_mates). The iOS version of this app will be released soon.
